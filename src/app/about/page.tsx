                    <p className="mt-5 aboutP"> 
                    The idea for Arada Dictionary has come from a personal struggle. Finding a reliable online resource for deciphering Amharic slang words and informal talk was difficult. There was only one Facebook Channel I found dedicated to slang and Informal Amharic words, but It was outdated and Inactive most of the time. Faced with this challenge, I decided to take matters into my own hands and build a solution from scratch. And thus, Arada Dictionary was conceived.
